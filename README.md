## Running the tests

Tests are designed to demonstrate the algorithm of calculating the age of a person on different planets.

To run the tests:
1. Open Space Age Calculator project in IntelliJ
2. Go to Test files in test package
3. Right click and select "run all tests" or click play button next to each test to run each individual test.

### Break down into end to end tests

There are tests to check that each class has properties in the constructor and in the `SpaceAgeCalculatorTest` class to check that the result of calculating a persons age on each planet asserts the correct value.
